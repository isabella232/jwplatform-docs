<li><a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/docs/developer-guide/delivery-api/">Delivery API</a> v2 is now available on for <code>/v2/media/</code> and <code>/v2/playlists/</code>. These endpoints provide JSON or RSS responses for individual media items and playlists including all media items.<ul>
<li>These endpoints have additional request-time parameters including poster image width and pagination. More parameters will be available soon. An interactive API reference is available <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/docs/delivery-api-reference/">here</a>.</li>
<li>/v2/ endpoints use <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519">standards based</a> JWT <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/docs/developer-guide/delivery-api/url-token-signing/">url signing</a> if content protection is enabled.</li>
<li>JSON playlist responses include a pagination <code>"links":</code> parameter to iterate through videos beyond the first set returned.</li>

<ul>
<li>Ad impressions are now available as a metric in analytics. Users with advanced analytics can segment and filter ad impressions against dimensions of Media, Player, Feed, Device, Domain, Country, and/or Platform.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2016-12-14">2016-12-14</h2>
<h3 id="updated-features_7">Updated Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added a new video attribute, <code>updated</code> (a unix timestamp for when the video was last updated), in the JW Platform API. <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/videos/list.html">/videos/list</a> calls can <code>order_by</code> (<code>updated:desc</code> or <code>updated:asc</code>) or filtered by the <code>updated_after</code> parameter.<ul>
<li>The attribute is updated whenever:<ul>
<li>Media metadata gets changed (title, description, author, etc.)</li>
<li>Tags get added or removed from the media</li>
<li>Custom parameters are added, removed or values are changed.</li>
<li>When a tag is globally deleted (via the dashboard or <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/accounts/tags/    delete.html">/accounts/tags/delete/</a>) all media associated with that tag get a new updated value</li>
<li>Certain back-end processes (ex: transcoding operations) put a new value in the updated attribute although these updates may not have any user noticeable changes     reflected in the API output other than the new updated value.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Known Limitations (on our radar for a future update):<ul>
<li>At this time, if you change the name of an existing tag using the dashboard or <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/methods/accounts/tags/update.html">/accounts/tags/update</a>; associated media does not get a new updated value.</li>
<li>Adding or updating tracks associated with the media does not yet trigger an update of the associated media.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2016-12-13">2016-12-13</h2>

</ul>
<h2 id="2016-12-09">2016-12-09</h2>
<h3 id="updated-features_9">Updated Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Updated <a href="https://www.ampproject.org/">AMP</a> behavior to handle explicit play/pause events.</li>
<li>Updated the content API <a href="https://cdn.jwplayer.com/robots.txt">robots.txt</a> to disallow only links to /previews/* this enables strong SEO of hosted content. Users desiring to avoid indexing can use the <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/urls/previews.html">/previews/</a> players on their site whereas most users will want to use <a href="https://developer.jwplayer.com/jw-platform/reference/v1/urls/players.html">/players/</a> single line embeds.</li>

You can now designate a video as 360 including the stereoscopic mode from the video detail page or by adding the custom parameter <code>custom.stereomode</code> with a value of <code>monoscopic</code>, <code>stereoscopicTopBottom</code> or<code>stereoscopicLeftRight</code>. This will tell the player to use 360 rendering with the appropriate 3D mode. 360 formatted videos can be uploaded, transcoded and served just like standard videos.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="updated-features_10">Updated Features</h3>
