# Managing Your Library with the JW Platform Management API

The JW Platform Management API at api.jwplatform.com provides a set of classes for managing all aspects of your library. The JW Platform Management API features a straightforward authentication mechanism and multiple output formats (PHP, JSON, XML, Python). This reference describes in detail how our API works and which classes and assets are available. The sections below provide details on how asset management API calls are structured and mechanisms for uploading content to the platform.
