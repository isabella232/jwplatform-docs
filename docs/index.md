# Welcome to the JW Platform Developer Guide
It may not look like much now, but this guide will evolve into the go-to resource for best practices and examples on how you can take advantage of the JW Platform API to build your site and manage your content library. It will also be a place to find public [release notes](../release-notes) for improvements we've made to JW Platform.
